# Circled or squared characters transliterator

The Circled or squared characters transliterator converts Unicode characters that appear inside circles or squares into configurable template representations. This is useful for converting decorative or special-purpose characters into more standard text formats while preserving their semantic meaning.

## Overview

This transliterator handles a wide variety of enclosed characters:
- **Circled numbers**: ① ② ③ etc. (including double-digit numbers up to 50)
- **Circled letters**: Ⓐ Ⓑ Ⓒ (uppercase) and ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ (lowercase)
- **Squared letters**: 🅰 🅱 🅲 etc.
- **Special symbols**: © (copyright), ℗ (sound recording copyright)
- **CJK circled ideographs**: ㊀ ㊁ ㊂ (numbers), ㊊ ㊋ ㊌ (days of week), etc.
- **Katakana circled characters**: ㋐ ㋑ ㋒ etc.
- **Regional indicator symbols**: 🇦 🇧 🇨 etc. (used for flag emojis)
- **Japanese button symbols**: 🈁 🈂 🈚 etc.

## Configuration Options

The transliterator supports the following options:

- **templates**: Customize how circled and squared characters are rendered
  - **circle**: Template for circled characters (default: "(?)")
  - **square**: Template for squared characters (default: "[?]")
- **includeEmojis**: Whether to process emoji characters (default: false)

The "?" in the template is replaced with the actual character content. For example, a circled "A" (Ⓐ) would become "(A)" with the default circle template.
